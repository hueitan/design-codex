# List of all icons

The table below displays all available icons and their variations, including:
- Language-specific variants, labelled by [ISO code abbreviations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes). A default version of the icon for all other languages appears below the language-specific variants.
- The versions displayed in left-to-right (LTR) and right-to-left (RTL) script contexts.

Learn about how bidirectionality and language support works in the [Icon component](../components/demos/icon.md#internationalization ) or refer to general information on [Codex's built-in support for bidirectionality](../using-codex/developing.html#bidirectionality).
