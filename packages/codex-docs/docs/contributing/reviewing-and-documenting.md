# Reviewing and documenting

Once the implementation has been completed, the designer will need to:

- **Design sign-off**: Confirm the new component was implemented correctly.
- **Publish in Figma**: Add the approved component to the [Codex Figma library](https://www.figma.com/design/KoDuJMadWBXtsOtzGS4134/Codex?node-id=1891-4420&node-type=canvas&t=plW1hmguHVWs3fWZ-11) for reuse in design projects. Due to [team permissions in Figma](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039970673-Team-permissions), only designers in the Wikimedia Foundation Figma team can edit the library. If you are part of the team, create a Figma branch adding the component before publishing; if you are not, someone from the team will handle the publishing for you.
