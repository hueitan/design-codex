# Reporting and validating

## File a task

If the task doesn’t already exist in the [Codex Phabricator board](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/tag/codex/), create one using one of the following task templates, making sure to file in as much information as possible in the predefined sections:

- [New component][new-component-task-template]: Use this task template if you're proposing a new component that doesn't yet exist in Codex. Only the MVP version of the component will be built initially, with future features handled in separate tasks.
- [Update an existing component][update-component-task-template]: Use this task template to propose updates to an existing Codex component, such as adding a new property or variant, refining its visual style, or improving its behavior.

## Create an inventory

Create an initial inventory with the relevant use cases where this component will be reused. You can check the following resources to collect relevant information:

- [Codex component demos](../components/overview.md): verify whether the needed component has already been implemented, or whether it can be designed based on any of the existing ones. Make sure to compare components in the same category or with similar characteristics that could influence the approach.
- [OOUI demo site](https://doc.wikimedia.org/oojs-ui/master/demos/?page=widgets&theme=wikimediaui&direction=ltr&platform=desktop): check if this component exists in the OOUI demo.
- [Wikimedia web products](https://www.wikimedia.org/): detect current use cases of the component in the different Wikimedia products.

::: info
Include the use cases from the inventory in the task description to support validation and help prioritize the component’s implementation.
:::

## Validate the task

Make sure the task has been reviewed, validated, and approved before starting any work. This includes confirming that the component is truly needed.

Once the task is validated and the need is clearly established, you can move forward with the next steps in the contribution process.
