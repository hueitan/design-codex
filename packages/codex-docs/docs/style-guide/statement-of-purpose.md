# Statement of Purpose

At Wikimedia, we design with and for curious humans who rely on trustworthy content.

We as a design team work with a global community of humans who come from different experiences and places, with different goals. We are ever-evolving, learning, and growing. We remain open to change and feedback.

When making design decisions, we are guided by our principles. We use these guidelines to hold ourselves and each other accountable. We invite the broader community to engage with our design work on the basis of our [Design Principles](design-principles-overview.md).
