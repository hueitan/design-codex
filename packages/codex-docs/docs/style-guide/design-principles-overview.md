# Overview

The following principles correspond directly with our [Statement of Purpose](statement-of-purpose.md).

## Design with Others

We collaborate with others through means of inclusion of ideas, research sessions, and working as openly as possible.

- Is this design the outcome of collaboration?
- Did we listen to and learn from people with different backgrounds and perspectives?
- Have we learned from the target audience that their needs are met?

## For Curious Humans

We welcome and consider a universal audience, striving to remove barriers to accessing knowledge which satisfies human curiosity.

- Is this design accessible, inclusive, and equitable?
- Does this idea encourage or allow for adaptability based on the preference of the person using it?
- Is there opportunity for wonder in the experience?

## Trustworthy

We design to enable the sharing and greater understanding of trustworthy knowledge, while maintaining the integrity of people's privacy.

- Are we minimizing the data we collect about people in both our design solution and the process to create it?
- Are we communicating information explicitly and honestly?
- Does this design help users confidently access and share well-sourced, reliable knowledge?

## Content First

We aim for content to be at the center of Wikimedia projects, and to facilitate its comprehension and use.

- Is this design prioritizing the most contextually important information?
- Is the content presented in a way that supports clear understanding?
- Does this design help make it easy to learn from, improve, and share content?
